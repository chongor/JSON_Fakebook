JSON_Fakebook
=============

Coure Programming Project:  Using JSON, a fake facebook friend graph reader.  Implemented algorithms:  Connected Component Finder, Kruskal's Algorithm, Degree Centrality, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and Closeness Centrality.

A final project for a CIS course on data structures and algorithms.

Utilized JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) notation to generate a graph of friends for a fake facebook or "fakebook."

All files were given for the assignment, with the methods in FakebookReader.java being written by myself, for the reader to parse JSON files.

With most of the other files being the implmentation of algorithms, the implementation being written by myself.
